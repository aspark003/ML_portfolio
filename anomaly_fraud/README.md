Power BI Anomaly Detection Dashboard

Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow using Power BI Desktop combined with machine learning–driven anomaly detection.

The dashboard is designed to analyze structured financial-style data and automatically flag abnormal patterns, risk levels, and outliers using unsupervised learning techniques.

It simulates real-world scenarios such as:

Fraud detection

Risk scoring

Operational anomaly monitoring

Behavior analysis

Dashboard Features

Interactive anomaly detection dashboard

Risk level classification (Low / Medium / High)
